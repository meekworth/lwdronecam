# LW Drone Cam

This is a simple Android app that provides a streaming video view from a toy drone that runs the lewei software. 

The official apps in the Play Store require more permissions than I was confortable with and contain several compiled libraries that I don't trust. This app only contains Java code and the android.permission.INTERNET permission. It also doesn't have most of the features of the official app.

## Development

The drone I have and tested with is the Force1 Blue Heron U49W Drone. The embedded camera software is probably common to many other Chinese-made drones.

### Building

Built with Android Studio.
